This is a project that stems from my interest in the DNA-system as humankind knows and understands it.
It contains 2 projects where one is the DNA-system itself and the other a way to plug and play test it.

The base project is where all things DNA are programmed.
In the test project there is a separation between Flowers and Animals.
Flowers is the original version on how to deal with input and output. (this version is currently not able to start due to changes I've made to convert it to the better way)
Animals is the version in which I tried to use different methods to accomplish the same end-goal.
